# GoldenSaber
I would argue 99% of my personal projects in my entire programming career have been essentially game engine experiements that never get finished because I get ADD moments and want to experiment with entirely different technologies and approaches. Not this time! This time, I refuse to make a game engine! This project will be a game, with it's own engine of course, but no more thinking "Oh, but some people want to make this type of game or that type of game or use this type of asset or have this type of camera... etc"

Long story short, Golden Saber is not a game engine. It's a game inspired by Pokemon.
